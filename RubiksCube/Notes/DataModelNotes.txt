Notes about data structor
facelets are stored as chars as follows !
char Facelet; // wgrboy*


Move Class, that presents
each face has 2 moves total of 12
additional 6 moves for total rotation of the cube. x,y,z in each way total of 6.
data members 
NUM_FACELETS_TOTAL = 6 sides * 9 faclet
mTransform( NUM_FACELETS_TOTAL ), mCost( 0.0 ), mName( "Uninitialized" )

map data memeber that is 1-d vector.
     // M_EQ is named strangely due to cmath's M_E, the constant for the numeric constant e.
      // Don't know why we can't scope it away, but we can't.
      // M_IDENTITY is, I, and causes the cube to stay the same.
      // M_U is, U, the clockwise rotation of the Upper face.
      // M_UP is, U', the counter-clockwise rotation of the Upper face.
      // Similar for Lower, Front, Right, Left, and Down faces.
      //M_U White CW
      //M_UP white  CCW
      //M_L orange cc

CUBE CLASS 

std::vector< Facelet > mFacelets( NUM_FACELETS_TOTAL ) array total of 6*9 of wwwwwwwwww...etc default solved cube
operatoe left < right
for the first differing facelet, lhs is less than rhs
