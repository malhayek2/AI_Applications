Median optimal moves are 18, no more than 20 moves!
Of the 27 possible 111 cubies, 26 are visible,
with one in the center. Of these, the six cubies in the
center of a face rotate, but don't move. These six cubies form fixed reference framework, disallowing rotations of the entire cube. Of the remaining 20 movable
cubies, 8 are on the corners, with three visible faces
each, and 12 are on the edges, with two visible faces


/********* Heurstic best of 3 attemps **********/
If we consider just the eight corner cubies, the
position and orientation of the last cubie is determined by the remaining seven
-- meaning you should only look at 7 1x1x1 cubie
moves range 0-11

We can improve this heuristic by considering the
edge cubies as well. moves range 0-10
edge cubies are b-y, r-y, b-r, b-w, r-w, r-g

the other edge cubies, 

y-g, b-o, y-o, o-w, o-g, w-g


/**********************/
Corner cubies only move among corner positions,
and edge cubies only move among edge positions
does that mean we limit our moves?
. A
corner cubie in a given position can be oriented in any
of three ways, and an edge cubie can be oriented two different ways.

talks about having UU moves. for less nodes generated.
/*************************/
compute the minimum number of moves
required to correctly position and orient it, and sum
these values over all cubies. Unfortunately, to be admissible, this value has to be divided by eight, since
every twist moves four corner and four edge cubies

This result can be rounded up. A better heuristic is to
take the maximum of the sum of the manhattan distances of the corner cubies, and the edge cubies, each
divided by four
